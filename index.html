      Before joining the Teaching Assistantship Program (TAP), I was a passionate STEM learner seeking ways to contribute meaningfully to society. 
      Through the support of <strong>IEE Rwanda</strong>, I had the opportunity to work as a <strong>teaching assistant in Physics and Mathematics</strong>, 
      especially in underserved rural schools. I supported students in understanding complex concepts, improving their academic performance and self-confidence.
    </p>
    <br>
    <blockquote>
      “IEE Rwanda stimulated my vision and opened my spiritual insight toward my destiny.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This role shaped a vision in me: to support long-term educational transformation in countryside schools through a 
      <strong>tech-driven mentorship platform</strong>. I began envisioning a future where students, especially in public schools, 
      could benefit from global academic mentorship and accessible technology.

      IEE Rwanda and TAP helped me build a <strong>grit and growth mindset</strong>;essential for navigating both classrooms and broader community challenges. 
      I gained skills in <strong>lesson delivery, learner engagement, and professional communication</strong>. More importantly, I began to understand the 
      value of cross-sector solutions, leading me to conceptualize a project called the 
      <em>“Cross-Mentorship Academia Platform”</em>, which connects under-supported learners with mentors and experts from around the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I’m diving into <strong>software engineering programs and tech projects</strong>;not just for technical mastery, but to solve real-world problems. 
      What matters isn’t just learning to code;it’s using tech to build inclusive systems. TAP helped me realize that I must design for everyone, including those with disabilities.

    <blockquote>
      “I’m integrating into technologies that consider people with different disabilities; especially blind-person assistive tools to help them explore digital platforms.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Through these hands-on experiences, TAP transformed my thinking from technical to human-centered design. 
      I'm now passionate about <strong>accessibility-first software</strong>, bridging the digital gap for marginalized learners.

      Teaching in underserved schools opened my eyes to systemic inequalities in education, especially affecting rural youth and students with special needs. 
      TAP empowered me to analyze these challenges with <strong>empathy and innovation</strong>. 
      I now understand that <strong>inclusion isn’t a side goal—it’s a core principle</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <blockquote>
      “IEE helped me analyze potential socio-economic issues, especially in the young generation.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      TAP introduced me to <strong>inclusive education concepts</strong> and how they can be integrated into technology, teaching methods, and school culture. 
      From supporting girls in STEM to considering assistive tools for blind learners, I now view education through the lens of opportunity for all. 
      And I believe inclusive design must be embedded in the foundation of every academic and technological system we build.

      The Teaching Assistantship Program didn’t just shape my skills—it shaped my mission. 
      IEE Rwanda gave me the platform to see education as both a <strong>service and an innovation hub</strong>. 
      Today, I walk forward with a stronger purpose: to build <strong>inclusive, tech-driven academic systems</strong> 
      that leave no learner behind—regardless of location, background, or ability.
